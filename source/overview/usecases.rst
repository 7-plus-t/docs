Benefits and Use Cases 
============================================================

Thousands of organizations around the world use Mattermost to increase the productivity while meeting enterprise-grade scalability, extensibility and legal compliance needs. 

The most popular categories of use cases include: 

- **DevOps** - Supporting process and environment to enable software developers and IT operations professionals to work closely together in deliverying software and infrastructure changes with ever more rapid, frequent and reliabile updates. 

- **Workplace Messaging** - Enabling teams to work rapidly and dynamically in topic-based discussions accessible from any device and integrated with existing tools, content and processes, dramatically reducing internal emails. 

- **Integrated Messaging** - Embedding messaging in line-of-business solutions using Mattermost's extensive open source platform to offer the benefits of real time communication. 

Below we outline examples of use cases across categories: 

DevOps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a DevOps deployment, Mattermost provides the real-time messaging, presence  and integration layer across tool chain for Coding, Building, Testing, Packaging, Releasing, Configuring and Monitoring. 

Social Coding  
```````````````````````````````````````````````
aka Conversational Development, ChatOps

**Challenge:** Developers working in isolation often take longer to develop software, and the resulting solutions may have less consistency and more defects than software developed in effective teams. At the same time, co-locating developers removes their ability to moderate distraction and interruption, making it difficult to spend the extended lengths of time needed to properly design complex systems, and in many cases reducing job satisfaction. 

**Solution:** Offer developers a workplace messaging environment where they can join topic-based discussions from any device, with history and search, to: 

- Ask questions and get answers, as well as search for answers in previous discussions. 
- Learn about tools, dependencies, best practices, and changing business needs.
- Request code review and ad hoc testing, and group ad hoc testing for work-in-progress (Especially useful when working on complex designs).
- Discuss the feature requirements prior to opening tickets for implementation.

When developers need to work uninterrupted they can close or mute discussions and return to read their history later. 

**Benefit:** Software projects delivered in less time, with fewer defects, more consistency, and higher developer satisfaction. 

Chat Ops    
```````````````````````````````````````````````
aka Exception Handling, Integrated Error Reporting, No Ops 

**Challenge:** As DevOps teams release updates across development, staging, and production environments, exceptions, including errors and component failures, can go undetected, leading to degraded system health, degraded performance and even outages. 

**Solution:** DevOps teams can update their systems to send alerts to Mattermost on specific types of exceptions with mentions of specific individuals to draw their attention. Exceptions can be analyzed to solve undetected issues in the product code or deployment configuration. In the case of failures, light-weight, user visible automation can be created using bots to automatically restart services. The automated resolution of issues using bots on a messaging platform is sometimes called "going from ChatOps to NoOps".

**Benefits:** Fewer outages, higher system health, higher performance systems from faster detection and resolution of exception in software and deployment configuration. 

Integrated Incident Response with Legacy Systems 
`````````````````````````````````````````````````
aka Notifications Hub

**Challenge:** Legacy systems across the enterprise have alerting functions through SMS gateways that are difficult to use, maintain and update when ownership changes. 

**Solution:** Integrate legacy systems and workflow with channels that send alerts to key staff through email as well as mobile push notifications, with links back to channels where incident response workflow can be launched in real time across web, PC and mobile interfaces. 

**Benefit:** Faster incident response times, reduced complexity and management costs for backend systems.

Ops Theater 
````````````````````````````````````
aka Outage Response, Rapid Incident Response, Crisis Response 

**Challenge:** When critical systems experience outages or a security breach the process for responding to and monitoring resolutions can be slow, chaotic, and opaque. 

**Solution:** Backend systems push alerts into channels to bring key staff into an “operations theater” to work on rapid issue resolution in a channel, sharing messages, files and audio-video feeds until the incident is resolved. Meanwhile, stakeholders can monitor the situation in real time and a full record of events and communications can be provided for the incident report and analyzed for future process improvement and training. 

**Benefit:** Fewer, shorter and less impactful system outages.
